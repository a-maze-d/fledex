# Contributing
## Introduction
Contributions to this library are very welcome. I do reserve the right to decide on what will (and will not) be added to the library. Thus, before doing any bigger changes you might want to ask for feedback.

## Pull Requests
By making a pull request you agree to the [CLA (= Contributor License Agreement)](CLA.md) and during your pull request you will have to sign-off on them.

## CLA outside from pull requests
You can also agree to the agreement outside a pull request (even though that's more complicated, but might make sense for companies). Please contact me in that case

## Right
As a contributor you have the right to add yourself ot the [Contributors file](CONTRIBUTORS.md).
