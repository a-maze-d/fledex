# Color names
Urls:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors:_A%E2%80%93F
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors:_G%E2%80%93M
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors:_N%E2%80%93Z

The color names and attributes have been extracted from Wikipedia and been converted to a csv file and can be found in the [names.csv](lib/color/names.csv) file.
Only modification made was to rename Vermilion, since it appears twice in the data. We now have a Vermilion and Vermilion2
