# Intro
Even though this library is published, there are things I still want to do before I consider this
as really done. Here the outstanding tasks that I can think of.
# Tasks
- [ ] Add installation instructions
- [ ] Provide several notebook examples (test env, prod)
- [x] Perform an extra round of testing (also on hardware)
- [ ] Change most configs to keyword lists instead of maps?
- [ ] Enable Telemetry
- [ ] Push the client code so that live updates would be possible (after every loop an update could be sent)
      This is now enabled through the LedAnimator module, but it's not complete enough to tick it off.
- [ ] Get the library into nerves-livebook
- [ ] Add proper API/module documentation
- [ ] Add documentation on how to connect the LED strip to a RaspberryPi Zero (with and without level shifter)
- [ ] Cleanup files
- [x] Publish to hex (v1.1 has been published)
- [ ] Fix all credo issues by running `mix credo --all`
