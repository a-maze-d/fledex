# Intro
Even though this library is published, there are things I still want to do before I consider this as really done. Here the outstanding tasks that I can think of.

# Tasks
- [ ] Documentation
  - [x] Finish the dsl livebook example (mostly done, but the send_config part is not done yet) (v0.3)
  - [x] Create another livebook (2b) that looks at the different aspects of the Leds module and how to work with it (v0.3)
  - [x] Create another livebook (7) for effects
  - [x] Add proper API/module documentation (at least for the most important modules) (v0.3)
    - [x] Fledex
    - [x] Fledex.Leds
    - [x] Fledex.Color.Names
    - [x] Fledex.Animation.BaseAnimator
    - [x] Fledex.Animation.LedAnimator
    - [x] Fledex.Animation.LedAnimationManager
    - [x] Fledex.LedStrip
  - [ ] Add type specs (at least for the most important modules) (v0.3)
    - [ ] Fledex <== This is maybe a tough one.
    - [x] Fledex.Leds
    - [x] Fledex.Color.Names
    - [x] Fledex.Animation.BaseAnimator
    - [x] Fledex.Animation.LedAnimator
    - [x] Fledex.Animation.LedAnimationManager
    - [x] Fledex.LedsDriver
  - [ ] Improve hexdocs
    - [x] add livebooks (v0.3)
    - [ ] create cheatsheet (v0.4)
  - [ ] Add documentation on how to connect the LED strip to a RaspberryPi Zero (v0.4) 
  - [ ] Add installation instructions (v0.4)
  - [ ] Add documentation on how to conncet the LED strip to a RPI with a level shifter (v0.7)

- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Add more error handling scenarios (v0.4)
- [ ] Cleanup
  - [x] Change from `@behaviour` to `use` and make BaseAnimation the base for the animators
        moving the implementations down to the base but allow overides (v0.3)
  - [x] Remove dialyzer warnings
  - [x] Big renaming (v0.3)
  - [x] Rename `LedsDriver` --> `LedStrip` (v0.3)
  - [x] Split BaseAnimation into the interface part and the base part (v0.3)
  - [x] Rename the BaseAnimation to take advantage of the namespace. (v0.3)
  - [x] Rename the LedAnimationManager to take advantage of the namespace (v0.3)
  - [x] Rename the LedAnimator to just Animator (v0.3)
  - [x] Rename the specific drivers to not contain Driver in the name (since it's already in the namespace) (v0.3)
  - [x] Rename the `def-func` and `send_config_func` to make it more natural in the dsl? (v0.3) <-- The send_config_func has been deprecated in favor of an effects interface
  - [ ] Improve the Fledex configuration. The fledex_config/0 function feels very wrong (rethink the animator split up. Also effects raise the questions whether static "animations" should really be so static, since the effect would have any real effect on them) (v0.3 or v0.4)
  - [ ] Improve the LedsDriver config (v0.4)
  - [ ] Fix flaky tests (see TODOs) (v0.4)
  - [ ] Perform an extra round of testing on hardware (v0.4)
  - [ ] Enable Telemetry? (v0.5)
  - [ ] Upgrade to a hex released version of circuits_sim as soon as available (v0.?)
- [ ] Missing functionality
  - [ ] set the effect trigger in the animator to the strip name if not set
  - [ ] Improve on the option handling in the fledex macros. Just pass them straight on to the animators
  - [ ] see the project plan that was planned out with my son, we are not quite there yet (v0.4?)
  - [ ] Connect everything into a supervision tree (to make it more robust) (v0.4)
  - [ ] Use protocols ?
    - [x] Drivers <-- No, doesn't make sense in this case
    - [x] Conversions `to_rgb`, `to_colorint` <-- decided against it to allow having simple structures (tuple) instead of (module)structs. Protocols don't seem to work with those.
    - [ ] ??? animations & components?
  - [ ] Create a dsl (domain specific language) to (finally) easily program strips
    - [x] Extend the Fledex macros with an effect marco (v0.3)
    - [ ] Extend the Fledex macros to allow easy configuration with a config macro (v0.3)
  - [ ] Clustering
    - [x] Create a driver that outputs through pubsub (on one node) (v0.3) and 
    - [ ] create an animation that consumes those (this allows to connect remote livebooks to a physical led strip. CAUTION: protect against loops!) (v0.4)
    - [ ] Provide examples on how to cluster (v0.4)
    - [ ] Add an example where several nodes are connected to transfer pubsub messages accross nodes (v0.4)
  - [ ] LED-component library
    - [ ] Create foundation for a led-component-library that enables defining reusable led components. For example both the clock as well as the weather example have a scale it would be easy to define those as components that would make it easier to defining certain aspects (v0.5)
- [ ] Increase consumption
  - [ ] Use in school project (v0.4)
  - [ ] Talk on meetups? (v0.5 or v0.6)
  - [ ] Publish/announce on Elixirforum (v0.5 or v0.6)
  - [ ] Get the library into nerves-livebook (v0.7)
