# Intro
Even though this library is published, there are things I still want to do before I consider this as really done. Here the outstanding tasks that I can think of.

# Tasks
- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Finish the dsl livebook example (mostly done, but the send_config part is not done yet) (v0.3)
  - [x] Create another livebook (2b) that looks at the different aspects of the Leds module and how to work with it (v0.3)
  - [ ] Add proper API/module documentation (at least for the most important modules) (v0.3)
    - [ ] Fledex
    - [x] Fledex.Leds
    - [x] Fledex.Color.Names
    - [ ] Fledex.Animation.BaseAnimator
    - [ ] Fledex.Animation.LedAnimationManager
    - [ ] Fledex.Animation.LedAnimator
    - [ ] Fledex.LedsDriver
  - [ ] Add type specs (at least for the most important modules) (v0.3)
    - [ ] Fledex
    - [x] Fledex.Leds
    - [x] Fledex.Color.Names
    - [ ] Fledex.Animation.BaseAnimator
    - [ ] Fledex.Animation.LedAnimationManager
    - [ ] Fledex.Animation.LedAnimator
    - [ ] Fledex.LedsDriver  - [ ] Improve hexdocs
    - [x] add livebooks (v0.3)
    - [ ] create cheatsheet (v0.3)
  - [ ] Add documentation on how to connect the LED strip to a RaspberryPi Zero (with and without level shifter).This could be part of the first example (v0.3 & v0.4)
  - [ ] Add installation instructions (v0.4)
- [ ] Create a dsl (domain specific language) to (finally) easily program strips
  - [ ] Extend the Fledex macros to allow easy configuration with a config macro (v0.3)
- [ ] Clustering
  - [ ] Provide examples on how to cluster (v0.3)
  - [ ] Add an example where several nodes are connected to transfer pubsub messages accross nodes (v0.3)
  - [ ] Create a driver that outputs through pubsub (on one node) and an animation that consumes those (this allows to connect remote livebooks to a physical led strip) (v0.4)
- [ ] Cleanup
  - [ ] Fix flaxy tests (see TODOs) (v0.3)
  - [ ] Perform an extra round of testing on hardware (v0.3)
  - [ ] Enable Telemetry? (v0.5)
  - [ ] Upgrade to a hex released version of circuits_sim as soon as available (v0.?)
- [ ] Missing functionality
  - [ ] see the project plan that was planned out with my son, we are not quite there yet
  - [ ] Connect everything into a supervision tree (to make it more robust) (v0.4)
  - [ ] Use protocols
    - [ ] Drivers
    - [x] Conversions `to_rgb`, `to_colorint` <-- decided against it to allow having simple structures (tuple) instead of (module)structs. Protocols don't seem to work with those.
    - [ ] ??? animations & components?
- [ ] LED-component library
  - [ ] Create foundation for a led-component-library that enables defining reusable led components. For example both the clock as well as the weather example have a scale it would be easy to define those as components that would make it easier to defining certain aspects (v0.5)
- [ ] Increase consumption
  - [ ] Use in school project (v0.4)
  - [ ] Talk on meetups? (v0.5 or v0.6)
  - [ ] Publish/announce on Elixirforum (v0.5 or v0.6)
  - [ ] Get the library into nerves-livebook (v0.7)
