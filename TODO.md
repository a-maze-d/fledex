# Intro
This is a list of tasks that should be done before we can consider it as a 0.1 version
and being ready for publication

# Tasks
- [x] Allow multi LedStripDriver modules at the same time (requires also reworking the LedDriver config to namespace the configs)
- [x] Add tests for the LedStripDriver modules (that changes really work)
- [ ] Allow setting color correction to the LedStripDriver (I think every strip driver should get a different one)
- [ ] Enable Telemetry (?)
- [ ] Add copyright notice (incl. contribution policy file)
- [ ] Add proper Readme including examples
- [ ] Add installation instructions
- [ ] Provide several notebook examples (test env, prod)
- [ ] Perform an extra round of testing (also on hardware)
- [ ] Create a new TODO list which is ready for publication
- [ ] Cleanup files
- [x] Check use of fledex as a project name
- [x] Resolve all code TODOs
- [ ] Tag git repository
- [ ] Push to github
- [ ] Publish to hex
