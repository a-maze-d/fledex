# Intro
Even though this library is published, there are things I still want to do before I consider this
as really done. Here the outstanding tasks that I can think of.
# Tasks
- [ ] Add installation instructions
- [ ] Provide several notebook examples (test env, prod)
- [ ] Perform an extra round of testing (also on hardware)
- [ ] Change most configs to keyword lists instead of maps?
- [ ] Enable Telemetry
- [ ] Push the client code so that live updates would be possible (after every loop an update could be sent)
- [ ] Get the library into nerves-livebook
- [ ] Add proper API/module documentation
- [ ] Add documentation on how to connect the LED strip to a RaspberryPi Zero (with and without level shifter)
- [ ] Cleanup files
- [x] Publish to hex
