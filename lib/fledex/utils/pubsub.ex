defmodule Fledex.Utils.PubSub do
  @moduledoc """
  This module collects all functions that are about publish and subscribe (PubSub)
  functionality.

  PubSub is used for 2 things (more things are likely to be added in the future):
  * Notifications related to `trigger`s (when repaints happen). You can inject into this information flow by calling `broadcast_trigger/1`
  * Notifications related to `state` changes. Those are triggered mainly by effects, but also an animation can publish them. `Fledex.Animation.Coordinator`s are the main consumer of those events to then take appopriate actions. Those events are published through `broadcast_state/2`
